    <h3 class="treasury-title"><em>The Path to Representation, Self-Determination, and Survival</em></h3>

    <p class="treasury-copy">
	
Under Article 1 of the <em>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</em>, to which the Commonwealth of Australia is a signatory, all peoples possess the right of self-determination. This right does not originate from government but from peoplehood itself: it belongs to every distinct people by virtue of their existence. Under Article 27 of the same Covenant, minorities are likewise guaranteed the right to preserve their culture, language, and continuity within the states they inhabit.</p>

    <p class="treasury-copy">The Australish, being a historic ethnocultural people formed on this soil, therefore hold both rights concurrently: the right of self-determination as a people and the right of minority protection as a community now reduced to roughly one in four citizens within their own homeland. The Australish Rights Council exists to exercise these rights through lawful form — ensuring that recognition, representation, and continuity are secured within the Commonwealth framework.</p>
	
	
    <h4 class="treasury-title"><em>The Australish Minority</em></h4>
	
	<div class="rounded-frame">  <img src="images/demographics.png" alt="Charter" style="width:100%"></div>
	  
	  <p>The Australish now constitute a clear minority within their own nation — roughly one quarter of the population — meeting every accepted international criterion of a minority: distinct ethnicity, numerical inferiority, and non-dominant status. Their exclusion from census categories, heritage policy, and institutional recognition has rendered them statistically invisible — a people erased not by conquest but by omission. Under these conditions, the call for representation is not a demand for privilege but the correction of a structural absence. The establishment of the Australish Rights Council therefore stands as the lawful means by which Australia’s unrecognised founding minority seeks to secure its continuity and rightful standing within the Commonwealth order.</p>
	
    <h4 class="treasury-title"><em>The Australish People</em></h4>
	
    <p class="treasury-copy">
	Furthermore, Australia may have one citizenship, but it does not follow that it has only one people. As seen in Canada, South Africa, or the United Kingdom, a single state can lawfully contain multiple historic peoples, all sharing citizenship while maintaining distinct inherited identities. “Australian” is a civic category — a multicultural legal status open to any person granted citizenship, regardless of ancestry or culture. A person may hold Australian citizenship while possessing only the language, customs, and identity of their ethnic people, and this does not affect how "Australian" they are. By contrast, “Australish” is not a civic status but an ethnocultural one, inherited through descent from the founding settler population. If every Australish citizen were removed from Australia, and the population that remained still held Australian citizenship, the country would be just as Australian as it ever was. This illustrates how “Australian” is a civic identity, while “Australish” names an ethnocultural people — one whose existence is not guaranteed simply by the maintenance of the state.

	       <div class="rounded-frame"><img src="images/rebellion.jpg" alt="Eureka Rebellion" style="width:100%"></div>
			<p><em><strong>The Eureka Rebellion</strong> — when Australish men first raised a flag in rebellion against rule without representation. Today, unauthorised public use of that same flag is prohibited under Federal Court order, while no such prohibition applies to the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander flags.</p></em>
			
    <p class="treasury-copy">

      The Australish people — as with any people — cannot be represented until they are recognised in law. If no formal body exists, then legally the Australish people do not exist — and what does not exist cannot be represented. Without legal recognition, their interests cannot be heard, and without representation, their decline proceeds without objection or record until culminating in erasure. Recognition grants standing — the status required to be considered in law, to enter public record, to petition formally,
      and to secure priority in decisions that distribute power and resources.
      <strong>Without standing, a people will be excluded entirely from consideration in every institutional decision</strong> — which is the current state of affairs.
    </p>
	
	
    <h4 class="treasury-title"><em>The Australish Rights Council</em></h4>

  <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px;">
      To gain that standing, a people must first speak through an institution that can be recognised in law.
      For that reason, we have prepared the <strong>Australish Declaration</strong>, a founding charter of intent to begin the establishment of the
      <strong>Australish Rights Council</strong> — a civic body grounded in treasury, ledger, and defined milestones, so that representation for  the native founding population of Australia begins not as sentiment but as structure.

  <!-- CHARTER IN BRIEF -->
  <section id="charter" class="bright-band">
    <div class="container">
      <div style="margin-top:18px">
 <h2>The Australish Declaration</h2>

		<div class="rounded-frame">  <img src="images/charter.png" alt="Charter" style="width:100%"></div>
    </div>
	
    <p>
      The Australish people stand today without recognition in the Commonwealth they founded. A people unrecognised is a people already being erased.</p>
	  
	      <p>Under the <em>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</em>, the rights of a people to self-determination (Article 1) and of a minority to preserve its culture and continuity (Article 27) are recognised in law. The absence of recognition therefore constitutes not a political misfortune but a breach of obligation: a people cannot be said to enjoy these rights if it possesses no lawful means to exercise them. <strong>THE AUSTRALISH DECLARATION</strong> answers that deficiency by providing form through which existing rights may be lawfully exercised.    </p>

	  
	  
	  <p>The Declaration marks the moment a people organises itself and hereby founds the  <strong>Australish Rights Council</strong> — first as a civic body grounded in treasury, ledger, and witness, and in time to be
      established as a statutory body in Commonwealth law. This Charter of Intent sets the ordered path by which a people passes from sentiment to structure, from private
      conviction to representation, from scattered voices to a recognised Council able to stand in law and in public record. Power in the Commonwealth is exercised according to established norms and mechanisms. Sentiment, protest, activism, and even a voting majority, without institutional form, do not enter those mechanisms. Only through deliberate navigation of recognised structures can a people take part in the processes by which representation and authority are allocated. Put simply: the system has rules, and only those who organise according to them are heard by it.
    </p>
			
		  <p>In issuing this Declaration, the Australish people form their Council in principle. 
Even before any law is passed, such a Council carries real authority — because a people who organise, keep a ledger, and hold a treasury are already exercising representation. In doing so, they move from possessing rights in principle to exercising them in fact — transforming abstract entitlement into institutional presence.

The mid-term objective is statutory recognition: that a future <em>Act to Constitute the Australish Rights Council </em>would recognise both the Council and the Australish people themselves in Commonwealth law — affirming their standing as a historic ethnocultural community and securing in statute the dual rights of self-determination and minority protection that already exist in principle.</p>
			
		  <p>The Council’s <strong>Operational Directive </strong>accompanies this Declaration as its working instrument — setting out the staged goals, mechanisms, and institutional milestones by which the Declaration passes from proclamation to established authority. It includes a Petition and Public Challenge phase, authorising formal correspondence with Parliament once the Witness Roll is sufficiently established.</p>

    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
      <strong>Contributions</strong> from members and supporters are not donations of sentiment but acts of institution.
      Each entry into the Treasury advances the Council from declaration to embodiment — funding the legal and material
      steps required for the Council to exist in law, in record, and in public standing. Through these acts, the Australish seek the fulfilment of both their inherited rights as a people — the right of self-determination, and the right of minority continuity and protection within the Commonwealth. All contributions are entered into
      the open Ledger and applied exclusively to the milestones set out in the Operational Directive, including the launch
      address, White Paper issuance, CLG incorporation, membership and ledger systems, and the first sealed publications
      of the Council.

    <!-- 1. Immediate legal action -->
    <li>
      <strong>Legal Incorporation & ACNC Registration</strong><br>
      <span class="small muted">Register the Council as a Company Limited by Guarantee and enter the ACNC Human Rights subtype, securing legal standing, donation legitimacy, and eligibility to act as a recognised body.</span>

    <!-- 2. White Paper – key strategic step -->
    <li>
      <strong>White Paper — <em>Act to Constitute the Australish Rights Council</em></strong><br>
      <span class="small muted">Draft and issue the legislative proposal for statutory recognition, formally positioning the Council within Commonwealth procedural channels alongside other recognised councils.</span>

    <!-- 3. Ceremonial threshold action -->
    <li>
      <strong>Council Seal & First Ledger Pressing at Eureka <span class="small muted">(performed once the ceremonial threshold is met — at $8,000 Treasury and 50 Patrons recorded in Ledger)</span></strong><br>
      <span class="small muted">Strike the Council Seal and inscribe the Ledger physically at a public ceremony on Eureka ground — transforming the Council’s existence from declaration to visibly sealed institution.</span>
    </li>

<li>
  <strong>Outreach & Public Correspondence</strong><br>
  <span class="small muted">Establish the first correspondence channels under Council name — issuing formal notices, communicating with supporters, institutions, and press, and opening a path for structured engagement rather than informal advocacy.</span>
</li>


    <!-- 4. Combined institutional build works -->
    <li>
      <strong>Infrastructure & Publication Works</strong><br>
